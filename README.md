# Project Title

# Project Description
Are people addicted to caffeine because of the caloric intake and volume? Would I be satisfied with a highly caffeinated beverage if there is only a little bit of it? Is there less caffeine in larger caffeinated beverages?

Is this per Serving or per Bottle/Can?

The caffeine amounts listed are always for the entire container – NOT for a suggested serving unless it is a multi-serve container like a gallon-sized jug of iced tea or a 2 liter sized jug of iced coffee.
Data Sources compiled by hand using the nutrition label, directly contacting the manufacturer, or from lab tests.
For many store or boutique brands data is scarce. Some manufacturers don’t test their products as it isn’t required by law. This is especially true of naturally caffeinated products like coffee or tea.
